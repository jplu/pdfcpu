Package pdfcpu is a simple PDF processing library written in [Go](http://golang.org) supporting encryption.
It provides both an API and a CLI. Supported are all versions up to PDF 1.7 (ISO-32000).

## Status

Version: 0.1.18

* Extended API to support webserver scenarios using Readseeker and Writer.
* Support for watermarking/stamping with a specific page of another PDF file.
* Extended logging into horizontal (Info, Debug, Trace etc.) vs. vertical logging (Read, Validate, Write etc).
* The CLI will produce regular logging if you use -verbose, or -v.
* The CLI will produce verbose logging if you use -vv.
* More tests in `api/process_test.go`
* More examples in `api/example_test.go`
* More scripts under `_scripts/*`
* Fixed #5, #39, #44

## Motivation

This is an effort to build a PDF processing library from the ground up written in Go with strong support for batch processing via a rich command line. Over time `pdfcpu` aims to support the standard range of PDF processing features and also any interesting use cases that may present themselves along the way.

One example is reducing the size of large PDF files for mass mailings by optimization to the bare minimum. This can be achieved by analyzing a PDF's cross reference table, removing redundant embedded resources like font files or images and by always writing back the file maxing out PDF compression. I also wanted to have my own swiss army knife for PDFs written entirely in [Go](http://golang.org) that allows me to trim, split, stamp and merge PDF content.

## Features

* Validate (validates PDF files up to version 7.0)
* Read (builds xref table from PDF file)
* Write (writes xref table to PDF file)
* Optimize (gets rid of redundancies like duplicate fonts, images)
* Split (split a multi page PDF file into single page PDF files)
* Merge (a set of PDF files into one consolidated PDF file)
* Extract Images (extract all embedded images of a PDF file into a given dir)
* Extract Fonts (extract all embedded fonts of a PDF file into a given dir)
* Extract Pages (extract specific pages into a given dir)
* Extract Content (extract the PDF-Source into given dir)
* Extract Metadata (extract XML metadata)
* Trim (generate a custom version of a PDF file)
* Stamp/Watermark selected pages with text, image or PDF page
* Manage (add,remove,list,extract) embedded file attachments
* Encrypt (sets password protection)
* Decrypt (removes password protection)
* Change user/owner password
* Manage (add,list) user access permissions

## Contributing

* Please open an issue if you find a bug or want to propose a change.
* Feature requests - always welcome
* Bug fixes - always welcome
* PRs - also welcome, although I can't promise a merge-in right now since `pdfcpu` is stable but still _alpha_ and occasionally undergoing heavy changes.
